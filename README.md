# Project BSQ

This project is about solving the **Biggest Square Problem (BSQ)**.
The goal is simple: given a board with obstacles, the program finds the largest possible square that can fit inside without touching any obstacles.

---

## How to use

First, you can generate a board using the script:

```bash
./generator_board.sh x y d
```

- **x** → width of the board
- **y** → height of the board
- **d** → density of obstacles :D

Each execution writes the output into a file called **board.txt**.
(You can also edit **board.txt** manually if you want to play with custom boards.)

Then, to run the program:

```bash
./a.out "board.txt"
```
